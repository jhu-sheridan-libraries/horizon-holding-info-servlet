A Java servlet which provides web services for accessing information from the Horizon ILS.

The main service provided is item information for Horizon ILS items in DLF ils-di (dlfexpanded) format, among other formats.

A borrower information service is now included as well.

Based on code by Tod Olson, significantly expanded by Jonathan Rochkind.
